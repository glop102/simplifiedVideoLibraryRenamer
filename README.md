# simplifiedVideoLibraryRenamer

Makes it a bit simpler to get your Tv Shows named for simple parsing by other applications such as Plex or Kodi/XBMC.

After downloading a show from various sources, the files typically will have odd labels and junk in the titles. This program makes it simpler to have very different title structures that you can still mass rename properly. It is simpler to use than a general mass renaming tool since it is specificly for the structure of Tv Shows. You can use it either directly on your video library folder, or have an import folder and later move shows to your library.
